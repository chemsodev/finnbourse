# Enhanced Actor Creation with User Management

## Overview

I've successfully enhanced the actor creation forms (Agence, IOB, TCC) to support creating users immediately after creating each actor. This allows administrators to set up complete organizational structures in a streamlined workflow.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Agence (Agency) Form Enhancements

- **Two-step process**: Create agency → Add users
- **Automatic user creation**: Users are created via API after agency creation
- **Comprehensive user data**: Includes email, phone, password, matricule, position, and roles
- **Financial Institution integration**: Uses proper financial institution selector instead of hardcoded banks
- **Form validation**: Ensures required fields are filled before proceeding
- **Error handling**: Proper error messages and success notifications

### 2. IOB Form Enhancements

- **Enhanced user form**: Custom user creation form with all required fields
- **API integration**: Direct integration with IOB user creation endpoints
- **User management**: Add, edit, delete users before final submission
- **Validation**: Email validation, password requirements, required fields
- **Professional UI**: Clean card-based interface for user management

### 3. TCC Form Enhancements

- **Streamlined workflow**: Create TCC first, then add users
- **Enhanced user form**: Comprehensive user creation with all required fields
- **API integration**: Uses TCCService for proper user creation
- **Data transformation**: Proper mapping between form data and API requirements
- **User validation**: Form validation with visual feedback

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Integration

- **Agence**: Uses `actorAPI.agence.create()` and `actorAPI.agence.createUser()`
- **IOB**: Uses `actorAPI.iob.create()` and `actorAPI.iob.createUser()`
- **TCC**: Uses `TCCService.createOrUpdate()` and `TCCService.createUser()`

### Data Transformation

- Form data is properly transformed to match backend DTOs
- Handles name splitting (fullName → firstname/lastname)
- Maps form fields to backend requirements (e.g., position → positionAgence)
- Ensures password requirements are met

### User Experience

- **Progress indicators**: Multi-step forms with clear navigation
- **Inline validation**: Real-time form validation
- **Success feedback**: Toast notifications for successful operations
- **Error handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Flexibility**: Users can skip user creation and add them later if needed

## File Changes

### New Files Created:

1. `enhanced-users-form-new.tsx` (IOB) - Enhanced user creation form for IOB
2. `enhanced-users-form-new.tsx` (TCC) - Enhanced user creation form for TCC

### Modified Files:

1. `AgenceFormSteps.tsx` - Enhanced with user creation workflow
2. `iob/form/page.tsx` - Updated to use enhanced user form and API integration
3. `iob/form/schema.ts` - Updated schema to include email and phone fields
4. `tcc/form/page.tsx` - Updated to use enhanced user form
5. `tcc/form/schema.ts` - Updated schema for enhanced user form

## Benefits

1. **Streamlined Setup**: Complete organizational setup in one workflow
2. **Data Consistency**: Ensures users are properly associated with their organizations
3. **Time Saving**: No need to create actors and users separately
4. **Better UX**: Clear, guided process with visual feedback
5. **Flexibility**: Optional user creation - can be done immediately or later
6. **Error Prevention**: Validation prevents incomplete setups

## Usage

### For Agence:

1. Fill in agency details and select financial institution
2. Click "Next" to create the agency
3. Add users with their details (email, phone, position, etc.)
4. Users are automatically created and associated with the agency

### For IOB:

1. Fill in IOB details
2. Click "Next" to create the IOB
3. Add users with comprehensive details
4. All users are created and associated with the IOB

### For TCC:

1. Fill in TCC/Custodian details
2. Click "Next" to create the TCC
3. Add users with their access details
4. Users are created and associated with the TCC

This enhancement significantly improves the administrative workflow by allowing complete organizational setup in a single, guided process.
